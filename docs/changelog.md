 <none> --> Added AnnouncementBanner and UI primitives (GridPattern, FloatingOrbs, TechFrame)
Introduce a modular `AnnouncementBanner` component and extract decorative elements into reusable UI primitives under `components/ui`.
The banner previously included hardcoded copy and example variants. Those were removed. Background effects and frame accents were modularized for reuse and configurability.
